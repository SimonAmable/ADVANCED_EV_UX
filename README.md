# Vechical Navigation UI - Android App

Our app is designed for electronic vehicles. It lets users navigate through an interactive map showing EV charging stations around, and has an outline for using car accessories such as unlocking, popping the trunk, and more. 

## The Project
This project was made during the uOttawa Hackthon for the Ford challenge, and was the first time our group worked inside Android Studio. We learned a lot, although we would have liked to include many more features like:

* A pathfinder navigation system
* Battery consumption
* Carbon footprint savings
* More settings options
* Upgrade UI
* Images of the cars in the App
* Better electric charging station finder with custom ranges
* etc...
